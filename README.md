# RoboScape Online Web Client

[RoboScape Online](https://github.com/gsteinLTU/roboscapesim-rs) is the simulation platform for [NetsBlox](https://netsblox.org)'s RoboScape project. Normally, to interact with the simulation, users would need to use the NetsBlox extension. This project provides a non-NetsBlox web-based client for RoboScape, allowing users to interact with the simulation directly from their browser. This enables easier use of RoboScape outside of NetsBlox proper, such as through [PyBlox](https://github.com/dragazo/pyblox).

Currently, this version does not integrate with the NetsBlox login system, so some features may be limited.
